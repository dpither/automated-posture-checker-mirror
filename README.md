Automated Posture Checker (APC)

The Automated Posture Checker is a system that monitors the posture of a user. Before the user begins work at a desk, the user would set up the APC by placing the camera at a position where it gets a clear side-profile full-body shot of himself/herself in a sitting position. The APC can then notify the user to correct their posture if the user slips into what is considered “bad” posture during their work session. Additionally, the APC can also remind the user to periodically change posture or move around to stretch. If the APC has determined that the user has been staying stiff and inactive for a long period of time, it will notify the user to change posture and/or move around and stretch. At the end of the work session, the user will stop the APC and get feedback on the overall properties and statistics of their posture and movement throughout their entire work session such as how long the session was and how long they had poor posture.
